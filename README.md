The name of the project is Harim.

This project is for many years.
In this project, I have tried to be able to lock or unlock a file in Windows.
This is a nostalgia project for me and not very technical.
I have presented this project as an open source so that its problems can be fixed or developed as desired.

Development language: C#
Thank you.
